**Dear customer,**

Thank you for contacting us at Vercel Customer Service. My name is Alina and I will be happy to assist you today.

As I understand, the enquiry is about the build issues you are experiencing with your project. 

Our customers can experience a variety of errors while interacting with the Vercel platform, but there is nothing to worry about. Weâ€™d love to get this resolved for you as soon as possible. Therefore, I would like to ask you to share some additional information with us as this will speed up the issue-solving process. Please reply to this email by confirming the following:
- Have you used the troubleshooting views on your dashboard as per the documentation here?
- If your build failed, what error message reports Vercel on your Deployment page?

We are looking forward to hearing from you.

Have a great day and take care,

**Alina**
**Vercel CSE**
