In my most recent position, I had to deal with Google customers' queries regarding billing questions which were mostly related to technical issues.

The most recent case assigned to me was to enable the customer's account manager, to perform the payment from an online account whose payment method was blocked, due to sanctions. The situation was difficult as the customer had two accounts and the payment used to be made from both at once to different Google entities.

By analysing the created situation, an action plan based on the balance transfer method had to be compiled. The method was about to fail as the legal department denied this operation due to the existence of different payment entities.

So, my main goal was to get an additional agreement entitled to transfer the debts from one account to another. As a result of efficient cooperation between the customer's sales representative, the account manager, the legal department colleagues and myself as the billing specialist we managed to solve this issue by crediting the concerned account and debiting the targeted one.

My involvement was vital as we avoided the situation when the customer could be switched off from the main Google services and could continue product usage. I consider this experience the most eloquent as the aforementioned situation is not common for the billing specialist.
