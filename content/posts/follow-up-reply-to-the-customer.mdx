**Dear customer,**

Thank you for getting in touch with us today.

I appreciate how frustrating this must appear. I am here to help you and will do the best I can to resolve this issue, but I am unable to do it before the root cause of the issue is detected. Therefore, the reply to the previous questions is vital.

Please rest assured once we get the related information, we will be able to provide you with a detailed, step-by-step resolution.

Should you still require further assistance, please reply to this email providing us with the previously (Email from April 15th) asked details.
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Have a lovely day,

**Alina**
