**Dear customer,**

Thank you for getting in touch with us today.

As I understand, You require assistance with redirecting from the /blog path to https://example.com?.

It can be implemented in various ways in Vercel.
The most commonly used is redirects within vercel.json like this:
```
{
  "redirects": [
    {"source": "/blog", "destination": "https://example.com?", "permanent": false}
  ]
}
```
The option "permanent": false will return a 307 Temporary Redirect while "permanent": true a 308 Permanent Redirect server status code.
More examples [here](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration).

Another common way is to make use of the redirects option in the next.config.js:
```
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/blog',
        destination: 'https://example.com?',
        permanent: true,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```
Good to know that redirects run before Middleware and may have a limit on platforms. For example, on Vercel, there's a limit of 1,024 redirects and to manage a large number of redirects (1000+), consider creating a custom solution.
More examples can be found [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/redirecting).

However, there might be more advanced use cases that need a personal approach and support from a dedicated engineering team.
If this is the case feel free to contact us with a detailed description.

Have a lovely day,

**Alina**
