As a result of the performed research, I concluded that one of the most common issues Vercel's customers are enquiring about is related to Building Errors.

These can be easily sorted by following the suggestions provided in Vercel's Documentations according to the error type. Even if there is plenty of information covering all aspects of building, testing and deployment, I would suggest a more efficient format for this document. 

A simple grid of common errors and the troubleshooting path will ease its resolution in a time-saving manner.
