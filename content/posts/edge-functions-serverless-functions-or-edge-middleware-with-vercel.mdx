Serverless functions can be deployed to a specific region and best suit the backend of event-driven applications that require rapid scaling and minimal infrastructure management. The most popular are image and video processing, IoT and real-time data analytics. Deployment in the same region with the main data storages and databases to avoid long network roundtrips is recommended.

Edge functions are global by default, however, Vercel offers to opt into a single region if this is the case. Ideally are used for applications that require low latency such as live streaming, gaming or working with sensitive data, as they prevent data transfer between regions.

Edge Middleware is part of request processing, is available globally only, and is always executed in the region closest to the customer. These are used for authentication and localisation of the content delivered to users maximising loading time.
